At this stage, we do not yet have code in our GitHub repository because our primary focus has been on building a strong understanding of the domain and the current state of the art. Over the past few weeks, we have been reading relevant research papers, analyzing existing approaches, and identifying key challenges and opportunities for potential research directions. For this checkpoint, each team member has individually written a research proposal based on our domain understanding and the insights gained from the papers we read. Please refer to the Project 1 Checkpoint Report PDF we submitted for more details.
